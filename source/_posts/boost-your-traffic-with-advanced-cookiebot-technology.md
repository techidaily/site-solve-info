For over 40 years, GEMLUX has manufactured the highest quality and most innovative marine hardware in the world, serving elite boat manufacturers such as Yellowfin Yachts, Maverick Boat Group, and Contender Boats. GEMLUX recently partnered with Formtran, a leading provider of document automation software and services, to slash processing time for complex, multi-line purchase orders from both customers and its suppliers by integrating ABBYY intelligent document processing (IDP) with its NetSuite ERP. 

By making purchase order processing more efficient, sales reps can spend more time helping customers and adding value to a new program that tracks customer usage.

Kailyn Nordsiek, ERP Systems Specialist

### Challenge

GEMLUX sales reps were spending 30 to 45 minutes manually entering data from customer purchase orders into their NetSuite ERP. POs could be 10 pages long with as many as 100 line items. Every time sales reps entered a line, they had to review customizations in place, while answering calls from customers.

On the supplier side, large orders placed with vendors resulted in many different POs, sometimes annotated by hand. Consolidating them required manual review that often added up to a full day’s work.

GEMLUX needed a solution that could:

* Shift sales rep time from manual data entry and line-by-line review back to helping customers
* Deliver data, even handwritten, from vendors, with the highest accuracy to their NetSuite ERP
* Be extended to process other kinds of documents beyond purchase orders
* Leverage an integration tailored to their needs

Now that we have put in place the integration for NetSuite to grab data from ABBYY IDP, we are pretty well set up to do it for other types of documents.

Rob Blackerby, Director of I.T.

### Solution

POs are now emailed to an address monitored by ABBYY IDP to get POs into NetSuite within 3-5 minutes. With automatic exception flagging, sales reps no longer need to interrupt customer service with line-by-line review.

The seamless integration of ABBYY IDP with NetSuite enables consolidation of line items for multiple supplier POs so shipments are processed in a single transaction rather than multiple partial transactions.

ABBYY IDP has the ability to process any kind of document. With the successful integration of NetSuite with ABBYY IDP, GEMLUX can extend those benefits to other areas of document processing.

### Value

* A 45-minute data entry reduced to 3-5 minutes
* A 6-hour process managing multiple supplier POs reduced by about 75%
* New opportunities identified for significant ROI by extending ABBYY IDP – NetSuite integration to other document processing use cases
