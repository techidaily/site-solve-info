# Musical Stats, BCR Tutorial, and Nostalgia

February 25, 2019

![](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26729/mobile-monday-69.jpg) 

We bet you are interested in finding out exactly just how much time you spend listening to music previous year. We‚Äôve got a hack how to learn it. We will give you a BCR tutorial, and send you to 80s.

## iOS Tip: Personal Apple Music Song Stats

Music follows us everywhere in life, sometimes for a few minutes, sometimes for days. If you‚Äôre a true music lover with a statistical bent, you may like to know the precise playing time of your music for the whole year, together with your most played songs and your favourite artists. For this, you can use [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208309), an app that was added by Apple in iOS 12\. If you haven‚Äôt already, you can download it [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8). After you‚Äôve installed Shortcuts, download the correct shortcut from [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5e5da935d1f940e59795ddf490f63559).

Once the installation has started, you‚Äôll be asked to input a year. Just a reminder that Apple Music was launched in 2015, so choosing 2014 or any year before that will give you an error.

![iphone shortcuts music](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26730/shortcut-music-2.png)

Once that‚Äôs done, tap the shortcut you‚Äôve just installed and wait for it to read the data from your music library.

You‚Äôll then be asked if you want a playlist containing your 25 most played tracks to be created. Say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs a deal you can‚Äôt refuse, this playlist should be ideal for you.

Once the statistics are ready, you have the option to save them as a PDF file in the Files app. Choose ‚Äúopen with Shortcuts‚Äù in the next popup (don‚Äôt use Safari to open it, our phone froze for a long time after we chose that option), and you‚Äôre good! (just like your taste in music üòâ)

![apple music wrapped](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26731/shortcut-music1.png)

Here‚Äôs a full list of things you can find out:

* The song you have listened to the most over the past year
* Your other most-played songs
* Your favourite artist
* Your other most-played artists
* Your favourite genres
* A collage with the covers of your most-played albums
* Detailed statistics about the total number of times a song was played, total playback length, and how long in total your top songs were played for.

To see the statistics for a different year, tap on the three dots next to the shortcut, scroll down, and change the year to any other (2015 or later).

## Android Tip: Spotify Wrapped

There are many music streaming services for Android gadgets, but one of the most popular is Spotify. So let‚Äôs do it! Just head [here](https://open.spotify.com/view/2018-page). The "Your Top Songs 2018" playlist should be in Your Library √† Made For You. Here you can check how many minutes you‚Äôve streamed last year.

Be sure that you‚Äôve listened to at least 5 different artists, 30 different tracks, and 60 minutes of music before Oct 31, 2018.

## App of the Week: Pacman

If you‚Äôre into nostalgia, this retro-style game will be right up your alley.

Any person that is even remotely aware of popular culture must have seen this big-mouthed round yellow guy at least once. His name is Pacman, and he enjoys running around in mazes, eating cherries and ghosts, all the while making his trademark ‚Äúwaka-waka‚Äù sound.
