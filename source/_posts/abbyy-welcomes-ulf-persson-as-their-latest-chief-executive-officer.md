Under his leadership, ABBYY has grown to become an established international IT company with 16 offices in 13 countries worldwide.

“Today, ABBYY is at a very exciting but also challenging point in its development. Our markets and operating environment are changing rapidly. Our challenge is to be at the forefront of this change, to be industry leaders. Ulf has been a board member of ABBYY for more than 14 years and therefore is well acquainted with ABBYY’s products as well as corporate aspects. We are confident that Ulf’s know-how and experience will bring the right skill set to lead ABBYY towards the new objectives,” Mr. Yang said in a statement.

Commented Ulf Persson: “I am grateful to the Board of ABBYY for the confidence they have shown in offering me this opportunity. I will work closely with the management team to further unlock our potential. ABBYY must be nimble, fast in making decisions and ever closer to our customers and partners. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Sergey for his great contribution to making ABBYY what it is today. It has been a privilege and pleasure to work together.”

Outgoing CEO Sergey Andreev commented: “It was a great pleasure to work with ABBYY for more than 25 years of my life. I would like to express my warmest feelings to the company and to all of my colleagues - the best people in the world. I truly hope that ABBYY will show its best sides and I am sure that innovations and efficiency in the company will grow much faster than before.”
