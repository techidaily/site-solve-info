_FineScanner, TextGrabber, and Business Card Reader have received the new iOS 11-based functionality._

ABBYY, a global provider of intelligent capture solutions to improve business outcomes, today released the iOS 11-powered updates for its productivity applications FineScanner, TextGrabber and Business Card Reader. Leveraging the added functionality of the mobile operating system, ABBYY has implemented PDF tools, Drag and Drop and neural network based auto crop in FineScanner; Drag and Drop and language detection in TextGrabber; the augmented reality (AR) demo mode, neural network based auto crop and Password AutoFill in Business Card Reader.

ABBYY’s multifunctional scanning app FineScanner is now fully compatible with iOS 11\. With the addition of PDF tools and Drag and Drop, the app has become an all-in-one mobile scanner and PDF editor. Users no longer have to use multiple apps to scan, recognize, convert, annotate, sign and share documents. PCMag Editors’ Choice for 2016, FineScanner easily performs all these tasks, while maintaining its signature excellent quality of text recognition in 193 languages. Via Apple’s PDFKit, the app has received a brand-new PDF viewer and a set of easy-to-use tools: signature, highlighter, pen, text box, and redaction of sensitive content. The Drag and Drop functionality allows users to quickly import images and PDFs to FineScanner for recognition and export scanned documents and recognized text to other apps. The new and improved, neural network based auto crop is noticeably faster and more precise. Seamlessly integrated into the scanning process, it takes fractions of a second to capture the page, correct the perspective and cut the rest for a perfect result.

Featured on TechCrunch, TextGrabber 6 transforms printed text into action in real time: users can recognize text in 63 languages, translate it into 104 languages, share, follow links, activate VoiceOver and more. The updated TextGrabber supports Drag and Drop for easy content exchange between apps and language detection for accurate text recognition. The app identifies the language of the scanned text and suggests it to the user.

Recommended by CNN and The New York Times, ABBYY Business Cards Reader now offers an augmented reality feature, which is particularly rare for business productivity applications. The new AR demo mode was created with Apple’s ARKit and lets users try the app with a virtual business card placed on a surface around them. They can experience how the information on a business card is easily captured by the app, to become a contact on their iPhone in seconds. The updated ABBYY Business Card Reader also has Password AutoFill for quick login and improved auto crop for effortless capture.

“iOS 11 provides the means for developers to add value to their mobile applications by implementing augmented reality, neural networks, and machine learning based features. We are happy to be among the first to give our users an opportunity to leverage these disruptive technologies to simplify their everyday tasks”, comments Ivan Bodyagin, ABBYY’s Vice President, Head of Personal Productivity Department.
