**_Popular Use Cases Include Video Game Design, Car Infotainment Systems_** 

ABBYY, a leading provider of recognition, data capture and language-based text analytics technologies, today announced that developers of complex and interactive electronics systems are increasingly using ABBYY’s recognition software, FineReader® Engine, for User Interface [(UI) test automation](http://hubs.ly/H029ZtF0) and robotic quality assurance (QA) to reduce the effort and labor typically required to produce high-quality applications.

Using ABBYY’s award-winning FineReader Engine, developers can quickly identify repeated errors during the traditional software quality assurance process.

“ABBYY’s FineReader stood out as the most impressive OCR engine because it works across the operating systems of several different devices,” said Antony Edwards, chief technology officer at TestPlant. “Our collaboration with FineReader allowed TestPlant’s software to advance beyond ‘image-based’ to become a fully visual automation tool.”

ABBYY’s FineReader Engine is best known as the leading text recognition and document conversion Software Development Kit (SDK). An increasing number of software developers are using its recognition functionality for extended and advanced capabilities, creating test automation applications that are not normally associated with more traditional use cases.

These include:

**International car manufacturers** are testing infotainment systems using ABBYY FineReader Engine to ensure that systems in every car are functioning correctly.

**Leading Developers** are interacting with ABBYY software in virtually the same way a human tester would, but with the productivity advantages of robotic automation.

**Video game designers** use the FineReader SDK to test their screens on computers, televisions, and mobile devices before release. Since testing multiple versions on multiple output devices is typically time consuming and complex, both engineers and developers speed their time-to-market by ensuring superior accuracy with FineReader Engine.

“With ABBYY FineReader’s advanced capabilities, customers can make their systems more intelligent, intuitive and productive,” said Butch Reh, vice president of licensing and marketing, US licensing, sales ABBYY’s North American Headquarters. “We’re looking forward to finding new and innovative ways to expand our partnerships using FineReader for graphical user interface test automation.”

ABBYY FineReader SDK helps developers and software companies by automating the GUI testing process on device screens like computers, tablets, car infotainment systems, mobile devices, and more.

Tapping into ABBYY’s heritage of language-based AI technologies, FineReader Engine also helps automatically avoid common problems associated with translating into other languages on multiple device screens at once. Problems include “[missing glyphs](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/missing-char-glyph/index.en)” and “[mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake)” issues, along with overlapping text, hiding text, wrong colored text, or proper responsive format spacing.
