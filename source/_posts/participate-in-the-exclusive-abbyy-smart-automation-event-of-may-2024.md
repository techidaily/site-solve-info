##### During September, global innovation experts educate business and IT leaders how to increase efficiencies and ROI using AI

The second annual [Intelligent Automation Month](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) takes place during September 2024 with online programs designed to help organizations from every industry understand the impact of purpose-built AI and how it can advance their business.

Weekly webinars will provide accessible and digestible information based on real-world applications, best practices, and current research that will help attendees know how to identify automation opportunities, navigate AI compliance and prepare for new regulations. Attendees will learn the benefits of key AI-powered intelligent automation technologies including process intelligence and intelligent document processing (IDP), including valuable input from customers, partners and technology influencers on how to strategically leverage AI and automation to maximize ROI.

Business and IT leaders and journalists are invited to join ABBYY in the following sessions to gain first-hand knowledge about overcoming common business challenges and achieving success with AI. These sessions will include industry experts alongside ABBYY leaders.

* **September 12th: E-invoicing is coming! Is your organization ready?** You will be ready after this webinar. Featuring Billentis, we’ll enlighten you on the current state of e-invoicing globally, with specific focus on Europe. We’ll discuss trend projections, the e-invoicing process, solutions involved (e-invoicing platforms, PEPPOL, etc.), and how purpose-built IDP aligns with business needs for efficient invoice processing.
* **September 19th: Panel with innovation leaders.** This fireside chat with executives from global financial institution, ING, and the Reveal Group, a global intelligent automation services company, will enlighten you on the latest AI tech trends and show the real-world ROI of using purpose-built AI to solve common business challenges.
