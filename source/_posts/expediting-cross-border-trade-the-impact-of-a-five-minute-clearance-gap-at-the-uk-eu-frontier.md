![pathner logo](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/insights/customer-stories/white-logos/customstrack_logo_2024_white.png?h=32&iar=0&w=120)

The administrative burden caused by BREXIT on both sides of the newly re-instated border between the UK and the EU causes headaches for manufacturers. CustomsTrack is a start-up company that uses artificial intelligence to simplify complex import and export processes. It identified potential to significantly simplify and accelerate the process of filing documents with the national customs systems through intelligent automation.

Having in mind the legal nature of customs declarations accuracy is of utmost importance. With ABBYY IDP, we experience 100% accuracy and 99% straight-through processing rate.

Joe Corcoran, Lead Consultant CustomsTrack

### Challenge

* The complexity of customs clearance processes for midsized manufacturers impact cross-border trade.
* The process is lengthy and cumbersome. Manual keying of data into national customs systems is error-prone, slow, and costly.
* Delays at customs due to missing or incorrect information is an issue, particularly for manufacturers of FMCG.
