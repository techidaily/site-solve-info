## Digital Twins vs. Simulation: Exploring the Differences, Similarities, and Synergies

###### Bruce Orcutt

August 6, 2024

The term “digital twin” has become increasingly popular in the business world, particularly in relation to process mining. But it isn’t a new concept. It's rooted in high-tech engineering, where it’s been instrumental in driving data-led innovation for decades. 

Simulation, like digital twins, is a valuable analysis tool. Both are useful in industries like manufacturing and engineering, where prototyping and testing is prohibitively expensive, and error margins are minimal. They allow you to design, simulate, and refine systems in the digital realm before you construct their real-world counterparts. So, what’s the difference between digital twins and simulation? 

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical entity, continuously updated with live data to mirror its real-world counterpart. In contrast, simulation involves using predefined data to model scenarios and analyze potential outcomes in a controlled environment. Together, they empower businesses to optimize their processes, reduce costs, and mitigate risks effectively. 

In this article, we’ll delve into digital twins and simulations, discuss their purpose and differing scope, and most importantly, the benefits of using them together.

## What is a digital twin?

**A [digital twin](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) is a virtual model of a physical object or system**. It works by creating a digital representation of the object and mirroring its real-time behavior, performance, and features.

To create a digital twin, the physical object—for example, a medical device or jet engine—is fitted with smart sensors to collect data on its behavior and functionality. The system will process and actively apply this information to the virtual model.

The main purpose of a digital twin is to remotely monitor an object’s performance, enabling you to identify potential problems and make informed decisions to improve the original physical asset.

## What is simulation?

**Process simulation, also known as [simulation](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), is a model of a system or scenario used to run experiments and study future outcomes.**

Simulations are typically digital models that use computer-aided design (CAD) or computer-aided engineering (CAE) software applications. CAD creates detailed 2D or 3D models of a product or process, which the simulation then uses to test variables and analyze the performance of designs under various conditions. You can also create simulations using mathematical modeling.

Simulations play a vital role in [process intelligence](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), allowing businesses to test changes before implementing them to optimize processes.

## What is the difference between digital twins and simulation?

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical object or system that’s powered by real-time data. Digital twins provide full visibility of an asset’s performance thanks to their continuous feed of performance data, offering accurate predictive analysis. On the other hand, simulation is a virtual model of a product or process used for experimental analysis. Designers can use a simulation to introduce or test specific scenarios and get theoretical performance data.

Some of the key differences between digital twins and simulation, in detail, are:

##### Scope

* **Digital twins provide a dynamic view of an object or process throughout its lifecycle**. They create a real-time, digital replica of a physical object or system by continuously integrating data gathered by sensors and other sources to reflect an asset’s current state and performance. Digital twins offer more than just operational insights. By providing a constantly updated feed of process data, historical information, and future projections, a digital twin is a comprehensive lifecycle management tool.
* **Simulation uses predefined data sets to perform experiments or run possible scenarios**. Simulations provide a mechanism to study system behavior and performance in a controlled, virtual environment, and don’t typically use real-time data. The scope of simulation is generally fixed to the duration and objectives of each specific experiment. It provides insights for planning, decision-making, and problem-solving within a defined context.

##### Data integration

* **Digital twins are active virtual models that use and deploy real-time data for continuous updates**. This two-way data flow creates a dynamic and accurate model that reflects the current state of its physical counterparts. Digital twins are an optimal choice for continuous monitoring, diagnostics, and optimization.
* **Simulations are static digital models that use predefined data sets and do not typically incorporate real-time updates**. These models remain unchanged unless a designer manually introduces new elements or parameters. While a simulation is great for experimental analysis, its lack of real-world data restricts it from delivering ongoing insights.

##### Purpose and usage

* **Digital twins are most useful for supporting asset and process management, as well as conducting predictive maintenance**. The digital model emulates what’s actually happening to a product. With this level of visibility, you can monitor asset performance over its full lifecycle to minimize downtime, avoid unexpected process breakdowns, and make proactive decisions.
* **Simulations, on the other hand, are more beneficial for assessing product design, training, education, and strategic planning**. CAD-based simulations enable designers to test a virtual model against a list of potential scenarios within specific parameters. Designers can use this data to evaluate potential process outcomes as well as develop strategies in a controlled, risk-free environment.

##### Interactivity

* **Digital twins allow for dynamic interaction with the model, so you can test different scenarios with real-time feedback**. Live data integration is a standout feature of digital twins that enables them to evolve and adapt over time. They continuously provide insights as more data is collected and analyzed throughout the product lifecycle.
* **Simulations require designers to set variables and parameters, before running the model, to observe outcomes**. They don’t typically incorporate real-time data, resulting in a more static model that requires manual updates. This makes simulation an ideal tool for running replicable scenario tests where continuous or adaptive insights are less critical.
