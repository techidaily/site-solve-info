## Boost Efficiency Through Customized Artificial Intelligence Frameworks

[Back to The Intelligent Enterprise](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/)

## Accelerating Automation  
Time-to-Value with Purpose-Built  
AI Models

###### by Slavena Hristova, Director of Product Marketing

Today, simply transforming data from analogue to digital is no longer enough. Deploying bots to automate low-value operations is no longer enough. The advancements in AI and machine learning are providing endless opportunities for efficiency gains, and businesses are eager to get to the results. 

Digital transformation, robotic process automation, hyperautomation, intelligent automation….

Artificial intelligence (AI) has overshadowed all of these, which were until recently very trendy approaches to streamlining business operations, taming data, and making information accessible and meaningful towards adding business value. 

Today, simply transforming data from analogue to digital is no longer enough. Deploying bots to automate low-value operations is no longer enough. The advancements in AI and machine learning are providing endless opportunities for efficiency gains, and businesses are eager to get to the results. 

For organizations, the fear of staying behind the curve and losing competitive edge by not implementing AI fast enough or well enough is very real. Employee concern has shifted from fear of losing one’s job to AI to fear of losing one’s job to employees who understand how to use AI to their advantage. The same applies to businesses: those who implement AI to achieve operational excellence, provide a better work environment, and utilize data to make better decisions will be the winners. 

Still, all AI is not created equal, and businesses must invest in solutions that solve real-world problems and help achieve desired outcomes without trading in compliance and reliability. AI that is purpose-built and highly optimized for the needs of the enterprise and specific use cases is the key to unlocking the most value with minimum resources.

Modern intelligent document processing (IDP) platforms, such as ABBYY Vantage, not only utilize artificial intelligence to provide quick, reliable, and accurate data from content—structured or unstructured—but also set a solid basis for deploying other AI technologies that rely on data to deliver meaningful results, such as predictive analytics, fraud detection, and AI-driven customer services. It also provides a foundation for expanding to entirely new ways of automation and process optimization by using IDP as a secure gateway to integrating large language models (LLMs) and generative AI.

ABBYY’s purpose-built AI approach is laser-focused and optimized for delivering accurate results with the highest possible quality, fast. 

The recently redesigned [ABBYY Marketplace](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) provides a rich collection of pre-trained AI models and assets, purpose-built for a specific use case or document type. Businesses automating document-centric processes can find and test AI models with real-life documents and deploy them into production within days, achieving exceptional straight-through processing rates out of the box.

Vantage’s low-code skill design and training enables different lines of business to explore and test document skills (AI models) based on their specific use case, adjust to their specific needs autonomously, and fully own the implementation of automation. These purpose-built AI models are helping organizations significantly accelerate time-to-value, quickly deploy new use cases, and achieve significant efficiency gains and resource savings. 

* Using a [pre-trained model for processing commercial invoices](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), ABBYY partner [Customs Track](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) has been able to achieve 100% accuracy and 99% straight-through processing rate, thus reducing customs clearance time for frozen pastry producer Portumna from one hour per truck to only five minutes.
* [Deutsche Post DHL Group](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) has achieved 70% efficiency increase in processing [remittance advices](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) and [invoices](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) through implementing an end-to-end solution with the help of ABBYY IDP and RPA.
* [Leading-edge cancer clinic Chris O’Brien Lifehouse](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) achieves $50,000+ savings per year and gains faster access to patients’ medical histories while reducing burnout for medical records staff.

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the pressure to stay ahead of the curve is more intense than ever. Organizations that embrace advanced AI technologies, such as ABBYY’s purpose-built models for intelligent document processing, are positioning themselves for success. These businesses are not just transforming data but revolutionizing their operations to achieve unparalleled efficiency and competitive advantage. Using purpose-built AI gives businesses peace of mind when exploring the vast potential of generative AI by taming its “creativity” and providing the guardrails to ensure reliable results, anchored in real, accurate data.

By leveraging ABBYY Vantage and the comprehensive resources available on the [ABBYY Marketplace](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), companies can quickly deploy AI-driven solutions that deliver immediate, impactful results.
