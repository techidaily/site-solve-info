Customer Onboarding Drivers and Pain Points STATE OF INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION REPORT | NOVEMBER 2022 

2 Customer Onboarding: Drivers and Pain Points Survey Methodology The survey was conducted by Sapio Research in October 2022 on behalf of ABBYY among 1,623 IT decision makers across the UK, US, France, Germany, and Japan. The purpose of this research was to reveal insights into customer onboarding drivers, why onboarding processes need to change, and what businesses need to do to address customer pain points—by activating the right mix of the human factor alongside automation.

4 Customer Onboarding: Drivers and Pain Points Key findings 

5 Customer Onboarding: Drivers and Pain Points Nightmare abandonment rates High abandonment rates and main drivers: • 9 out of 10 organizations are experiencing up to 40% abandonment rates at onboarding, and some even more. Another 5% have a complete lack of insight into their onboarding process, abandonment rates, and where abandonment is occurring within the process. • The top three factors that contribute to people dropping out during the onboarding process are: \- There are too many steps to get through (29%) \- Identity proofing and affirmation (26%) \- Too many manual steps (26%) • Banking is the sector experiencing the highest abandonment rates at onboarding, with almost 1 in 4 dropping out! Decision makers believe if abandonment was reduced by 50%, it would increase customer acquisition by 29% and increase revenue by 26% . Onboarding can easily be monitored, evaluated, and improved with intelligent automation. Reducing abandonment rates requires a more user- friendly and streamlined process with less steps and less manual input for customers. 

6 Customer Onboarding: Drivers and Pain Points Negative impact on business outcomes The result of onboarding abandonment are lost customers and business opportunities. • Missing out on business opportunities (37%) • Losing potential customers to competition (33%) • Struggling to attract new customers (31%) To stay ahead of the competition, businesses must avoid losing potential customers during the onboarding process. The onboarding process must be simple and pleasant. Businesses must strive for a better way. 

7 Customer Onboarding: Drivers and Pain Points Need for technology transformation Changes already made or planned for onboarding processes: • Although changes to onboarding appear to be leaning towards adding technology to current pro- cesses (44%), it is evident that human interaction is still part of the process (34%) • Process intelligence (21%) and intelligent doc- ument processing (IDP) (21%) are the top two measures that are being planned for onboarding • Modifying the onboarding process with more technology appears to have improved overall customer experience (43%) and increased cus- tomer retention (37%) Decision makers clearly state that automation technology that streamlines the proofing and affirmation of identities, IDP to effectively capture important information from documents and process mining for process insight and improvement, in addition to the human factor, will help onboard more customers. These intelligent process automation solutions improve the overall customer experience and retention, and eliminate tedious manual entry. 

8 Customer Onboarding: Drivers and Pain Points A better way for efficient onboarding processes • The survey shows how ineffective customer onboarding can lose a customer before they even begin using a product or service. If the process isn’t friction-free, the customer may decide the pain of onboarding isn’t worth the marketing promises. • The more time-consuming and complex an onboarding process appears, the higher risk of churn. There are several issues that typically cause clients to drop out during the customer onboarding process, costing a business new customers and the revenue stream that comes with it. • Onboarding processes need to change and businesses need to address customer pain points by implementing the right mix of the human factor alongside automation. • Businesses need to digitally transform ineffective onboarding methods by leveraging intelligent automation tools for identity proofing and affirmation, process improvement, and mobile document capture to empower customers to choose any channel they prefer to complete their onboarding. 

9 Customer Onboarding: Drivers and Pain Points Individual question analysis 

10 Customer Onboarding: Drivers and Pain Points How do you onboard new customers / constituents / citizens? Whilst almost a third onboard their clients / constituents personally, the majority use a combination of self-service and personal onboarding (43%) Combination of self-service and personal onboarding Personally, in the branch By self-service (e.g., online) Hand-signed documents by postal mail We don’t have a process that onboards new customers 43% 52% - UK 33% - France 30% 19% 6% 1%
